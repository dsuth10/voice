Performs performance and stress testing\n   - Measure response times under various conditions\n   - Test with long dictation sessions\n   - Verify memory usage remains stable\n\nImplementation approach:\n```python\n# Example unit test for AudioCapture\n\nimport pytest\nimport numpy as np\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock, patch\nfrom src.audio.audio_capture import AudioCapture\n\nclass TestAudioCapture:\n    @patch('pyaudio.PyAudio')\n    def test_initialization(self, mock_pyaudio):\n        # Test that AudioCapture initializes correctly\n        audio_capture = AudioCapture()\n        assert audio_capture.sample_rate == 16000\n        assert audio_capture.channels == 1\n        assert audio_capture.chunk_size == 1024\n        mock_pyaudio.assert_called_once()\n    \n    @patch('pyaudio.PyAudio')\n    def test_context_manager(self, mock_pyaudio):\n        # Test that context manager works correctly\n        mock_stream = MagicMock()\n        mock_pyaudio.return_value.open.return_value = mock_stream\n        \n        with AudioCapture() as audio:\n            assert audio.stream is not None\n            \n        # Verify cleanup\n        mock_stream.stop_stream.assert_called_once()\n        mock_stream.close.assert_called_once()\n        mock_pyaudio.return_value.terminate.assert_called_once()\n    \n    @patch('pyaudio.PyAudio')\n    def test_recording(self, mock_pyaudio):\n        # Test recording functionality\n        mock_stream = MagicMock()\n        # Simulate audio data\n        mock_stream.read.return_value = np.random.bytes(2048)\n        mock_pyaudio.return_value.open.return_value = mock_stream\n        \n        audio_capture = AudioCapture()\n        audio_capture.stream = mock_stream\n        \n        # Start recording\n        audio_capture.start_recording()\n        # Record for a short time\n        import time\n        time.sleep(0.1)\n        # Stop recording\n        audio_data = audio_capture.stop_recording()\n        \n        # Verify we got some data\n        assert len(audio_data) > 0\n        # Verify stream was read at least once\n        assert mock_stream.read.call_count > 0\n\n# Example integration test\n\n@pytest.mark.integration\nclass TestDictationWorkflow:\n    @patch('src.recognition.speech_recognition.SpeechRecognition')\n    @patch('src.ai_processing.ai_text_processor.AITextProcessor')\n    @patch('src.text_insertion.text_insertion.TextInsertion')\n    def test_end_to_end_workflow(self, mock_text_insertion, mock_ai_processor, mock_speech_recognition):\n        # Mock the components\n        mock_speech_recognition.transcribe.return_value = \"This is a test dictation\"\n        mock_ai_processor.enhance_text.return_value = \"This is a test dictation.\"\n        mock_text_insertion.insert_text.return_value = True\n        \n        # Create application controller\n        from src.app_controller import ApplicationController\n        controller = ApplicationController()\n        controller.speech_recognition = mock_speech_recognition\n        controller.text_processor = mock_ai_processor\n        controller.text_insertion = mock_text_insertion\n        \n        # Simulate audio data\n        audio_data = b'dummy_audio_data'\n        \n        # Process the audio\n        controller._process_audio(audio_data)\n        \n        # Verify each component was called correctly\n        mock_speech_recognition.transcribe.assert_called_once_with(audio_data)\n        mock_ai_processor.enhance_text.assert_called_once()\n        mock_text_insertion.insert_text.assert_called_once_with(\"This is a test dictation.\")\n\n# Example performance test\n\n@pytest.mark.performance\nclass TestPerformance:\n    def test_response_time(self):\n        # Measure end-to-end response time\n        from src.app_controller import ApplicationController\n        controller = ApplicationController()\n        \n        # Initialize with test configuration\n        controller.initialize(test_mode=True)\n        \n        # Prepare test audio file\n        import os\n        test_audio_file = os.path.join('tests', 'resources', 'test_audio.wav')\n        \n        # Load audio data\n        with open(test_audio_file, 'rb') as f:\n            audio_data = f.read()\n        \n        # Measure processing time\n        import time\n        start_time = time.time()\n        controller._process_audio(audio_data)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        \n        # Verify response time is within requirements\n        response_time = end_time - start_time\n        assert response_time < 5.0, f\"Response time too slow: {response_time} seconds\"\n```\n\nImplement a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar.
