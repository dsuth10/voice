# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and execute a comprehensive testing plan to ensure the application meets quality standards and performance requirements.
# Details:
Create a testing framework that:

1. Implements automated unit tests
   - Test individual components in isolation
   - Use pytest for test automation
   - Implement mock objects for external dependencies

2. Develops integration tests
   - Test component interactions
   - Verify end-to-end workflows
   - Test with different Windows versions and configurations

3. Performs performance and stress testing
   - Measure response times under various conditions
   - Test with long dictation sessions
   - Verify memory usage remains stable

Implementation approach:
```python
# Example unit test for AudioCapture

# Example integration test

Implement a continuous integration pipeline using GitHub Actions or similar. Add code coverage reporting to identify untested code paths.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run unit tests for all components
2. Execute integration tests for key workflows
3. Perform performance testing with various audio inputs
4. Test on different Windows versions (10, 11)
5. Verify memory usage remains stable during extended use
6. Test error handling with simulated failures
7. Measure code coverage and identify gaps
8. Perform manual testing of user interface and experience
