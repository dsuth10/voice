# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Speech Recognition Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the speech recognition engine that integrates with AssemblyAI API for high-accuracy transcription with fallback to OpenAI Whisper.
# Details:
Create a SpeechRecognition class that:
1. Integrates with AssemblyAI Python SDK (primary service)
   - Use real-time streaming API for faster response
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   - Add confidence scoring for transcription results

2. Implement OpenAI Whisper as a fallback option
   - Use the whisper-1 model for offline processing
   - Support local model for privacy-conscious users

3. Add a service selection mechanism to switch between providers

Code structure:
```python
class SpeechRecognition:
    def __init__(self, api_key=None, service="assemblyai", fallback=True):
        self.service = service
        self.fallback = fallback
        self.assemblyai_client = None
        self.openai_client = None
        
        if service == "assemblyai" or fallback:
            self.assemblyai_client = assemblyai.Client(api_key)
            
        if service == "whisper" or fallback:
            self.openai_client = openai.OpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    
    async def transcribe_stream(self, audio_stream):
        # Implementation for streaming transcription
        try:
            if self.service == "assemblyai":
                return await self._transcribe_assemblyai_stream(audio_stream)
            else:
                return await self._transcribe_whisper(audio_stream)
        except Exception as e:
            if self.fallback:
                # Try fallback service
                return await self._transcribe_whisper(audio_stream)
            raise e
```

Implement caching to avoid re-transcribing identical audio. Add speaker adaptation by allowing custom vocabulary for technical terms or names.

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests with pre-recorded audio samples of varying clarity and background noise
2. Integration tests with actual API calls (using test API keys)
3. Test fallback mechanism by simulating primary service failure
4. Measure transcription accuracy against known text
5. Test performance with different audio qualities and accents
6. Verify error handling with invalid API keys and network failures

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate AssemblyAI Streaming API [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement real-time speech-to-text transcription using the AssemblyAI Python SDK, enabling streaming audio input and handling API authentication.
### Details:
Set up the AssemblyAI client, connect to the streaming endpoint, and process incoming audio streams for transcription. Ensure the implementation supports asynchronous operation for low-latency results.

## 2. Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Add robust error handling for API failures, network issues, and unexpected responses, including automatic retries with exponential backoff.
### Details:
Detect and classify errors from the AssemblyAI API, implement retry mechanisms for transient errors, and provide clear error messages for unrecoverable failures.

## 3. Add Confidence Scoring to Transcription Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Extract and expose confidence scores for each transcription result, enabling downstream consumers to assess transcription reliability.
### Details:
Parse confidence values from AssemblyAI responses and include them in the output data structure. Optionally, highlight or flag low-confidence segments.

## 4. Integrate OpenAI Whisper Fallback (Cloud and Local) [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement fallback transcription using OpenAI Whisper, supporting both cloud API and local model execution for privacy-sensitive scenarios.
### Details:
Detect AssemblyAI failures and automatically switch to Whisper. Allow configuration for local model usage and ensure seamless transition between providers.

## 5. Build Service Selection and Caching Mechanism with Custom Vocabulary Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Develop logic to select between AssemblyAI and Whisper, cache transcription results for identical audio, and support custom vocabulary injection for improved accuracy.
### Details:
Implement a provider selection interface, audio fingerprinting for caching, and mechanisms to pass custom vocabulary or context to the transcription engines.

## 6. Implement Caching and Custom Vocabulary Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Develop a caching system for transcription results and implement custom vocabulary injection to improve recognition accuracy for technical terms, names, and domain-specific language.
### Details:
Create an audio fingerprinting system to identify identical audio inputs and cache their transcription results. Implement custom vocabulary injection for both AssemblyAI and Whisper services. Add support for user-defined technical terms, proper nouns, and domain-specific terminology. Include cache invalidation and size management.

## 7. Develop Comprehensive Tests for All Scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive test suite covering all speech recognition scenarios, including different audio qualities, accents, error conditions, and performance benchmarks.
### Details:
Write unit tests for each component using mock objects. Create integration tests with real API calls using test keys. Test fallback mechanisms, error handling, caching behavior, and custom vocabulary. Include performance tests for different audio qualities and accents. Test with various network conditions and API failure scenarios.
