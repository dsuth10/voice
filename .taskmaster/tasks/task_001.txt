# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Structure and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with proper structure and set up the development environment with required dependencies.
# Details:
Create a Python project with the following structure:
- src/
  - audio/
  - recognition/
  - ai_processing/
  - text_insertion/
  - hotkeys/
  - config/
  - utils/
- tests/
- docs/
- resources/

Setup virtual environment using Python 3.10 (latest stable as of 2025).

Create requirements.txt with the following dependencies:
- pyaudio==0.2.13 (for audio capture)
- assemblyai==0.17.0 (for speech recognition)
- openai==1.5.0 (for AI text enhancement)
- pywin32==306 (for Windows integration)
- pyautogui==0.9.54 (for text insertion)
- pygetwindow==0.0.9 (for window detection)
- pyperclip==1.8.2 (for clipboard operations)
- global-hotkeys==1.0.0 (for hotkey management)
- pyyaml==6.0.1 (for configuration)
- pytest==7.4.0 (for testing)

Implement a basic logging system using Python's built-in logging module with rotating file handlers.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the environment can be set up on a clean Windows 10/11 system. Run a simple test script that imports all required dependencies to ensure they're properly installed. Check that the project structure is created correctly and logging system works by writing and reading test log entries.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Version Control and Project Repository [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Git repository for the project, initialize it locally, and configure remote hosting (e.g., GitHub or GitLab) for version control and collaboration.
### Details:
Create a new directory for the project, run 'git init', and add a .gitignore file suitable for Python projects. Set up the remote repository and push the initial commit containing the base project structure files.

## 2. Create Project Directory Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Establish the prescribed directory and subdirectory layout for the project, including all required folders for source code, tests, documentation, and resources.
### Details:
Within the repository, create the following structure: src/audio/, src/recognition/, src/ai_processing/, src/text_insertion/, src/hotkeys/, src/config/, src/utils/, tests/, docs/, resources/. Ensure each directory contains a placeholder file (e.g., __init__.py or README.md) to allow tracking in version control.

## 3. Set Up Python 3.10 Virtual Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create and activate a Python 3.10 virtual environment to isolate project dependencies and ensure compatibility with the required libraries.
### Details:
Use 'python3.10 -m venv venv' (or equivalent) to create a virtual environment in the project root. Activate the environment and configure the project to use it for all development and testing tasks.

## 4. Generate requirements.txt and Install Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Create a requirements.txt file listing all specified dependencies with exact versions, and install them into the virtual environment.
### Details:
Write the provided dependency list to requirements.txt. Use pip to install all dependencies within the activated virtual environment. Address any installation errors or compatibility issues.

## 5. Implement and Test Logging System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Develop a basic logging system using Python's logging module with rotating file handlers, and verify its functionality within the project structure.
### Details:
Create a logging configuration in src/utils/ that sets up rotating file handlers and appropriate log formatting. Write a test script to generate log entries and confirm log rotation and file output.
