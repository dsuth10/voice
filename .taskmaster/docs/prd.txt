## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Python-based voice dictation application for Windows that provides quick, efficient, and accurate transcription from voice to text with AI-powered editing capabilities. The application will function similarly to Wispr Flow, offering seamless integration with any Windows application through keyboard shortcuts.

## Problem Statement

Current voice dictation solutions often suffer from:
- Poor accuracy requiring extensive manual editing
- Lack of context awareness for different applications
- No intelligent editing to remove speech patterns (ums, ahs)
- Complex activation processes
- Limited integration with existing workflows

## Solution Overview

We will develop a Python-based voice dictation assistant that:
- Activates via customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Transcribes speech using state-of-the-art APIs (AssemblyAI)
- Enhances text using AI (OpenAI GPT) for grammar, punctuation, and clarity
- Inserts text directly at the cursor position in any Windows application
- Provides context-aware formatting based on the active application

## Key Success Metrics

- **Transcription Accuracy:** >95%
- **Response Time:** <5 seconds total (speech to final text)
- **User Satisfaction:** >4.5/5 rating
- **Error Rate:** <2% for common use cases
- **Adoption:** 80% of beta users continue using after 30 days

## Target Audience

**Primary Users:**
- Business professionals writing emails and documents
- Content creators and writers
- Students taking notes
- Developers writing code comments and documentation

**User Personas:**
- **Sarah, Executive Assistant:** Needs to quickly transcribe meeting notes and compose emails
